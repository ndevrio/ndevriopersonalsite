**Hi, my name is Nathan.** I am an incoming Ph.D. candidate at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and a recent alum of the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at the University of Michigan. In short, my research interests involve the discovery and development of novel interaction technologies. To enable these technologies, I am particularly interested in the investigation of new or unorthodox hardware techniques for sensing and interfacing, and the creation of their associated software interfaces. Domains I am currently interested in exploring include activity recognition, health sensing, and virtual/augmented reality (XR).
