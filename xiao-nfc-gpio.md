  <h1 class="post-title">Using NFC pins as GPIO on Seeeduino XIAO boards</h1>
  <span class="post-date">May 28, 2025</span>

  Seeeduino's XIAO microcontroller boards are amazing for their small size and ample documentation. However, being so small, you may find yourself wishing you had just a few extra pins to use for input and output. This is where I found myself.

  So far, I have primarily used the Arduino IDE to program and interface with these boards. After doing some digging in the `variants.txt` configuration file installed by the IDE when setting up a XIAO board, I was interested to discover there are additional pins available.
